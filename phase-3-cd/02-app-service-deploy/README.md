# Step 2: App Service Docker Deployment

## Concept
Once the application artifacts (the Docker container) are compiled, security-verified via SCAs, signed persistently, and shipped to a private registry (ACR), the deployment environment must automatically be notified of an image update.

## Implementation Details
The `deploy` job orchestrates pulling the newly minted image digest into the target App Service container slots.

### Features
1. **Azure Web Apps Action**: Utilizes `azure/webapps-deploy@v2` targeting structural naming conventions generated by earlier IaC steps.
2. **Dynamic Referencing**: Maps `images: 'acr.../runtime-governance-app:${{ github.sha }}'` securing the identical cryptographic hash of code merged via commit SHA logic.
3. **Environment Segregation**: Relies on specific GitHub secrets and `id-token` write permission to safely login via Federated Azure OIDC matching `Azure app-projet1...`.

### Impact
Zero-Downtime image cycling orchestrated cleanly from Source Control ensuring CI merges actively affect the cloud node.
